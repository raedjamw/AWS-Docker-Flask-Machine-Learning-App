# AWS-Docker-Flask-Machine-Learning-App

This is a Project I am doing for a Machine Learning Engineer Job Application for a Large Company. This app returns results when entered via a POST request into a Machine Learning Model. The Model is a simple GLM logistic regression. The Frameworks used here are Docker,AWS EC2 instances,Flask APIs and Python.
